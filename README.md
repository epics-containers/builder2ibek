This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install builder2ibek`

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from builder2ibek import __version__

print(f"Hello builder2ibek {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m builder2ibek --version
```
